### MASK - the Mobile Android Sensor Kit

Our toolkit provides an easy mechanism for app developers to utilize sensor data from a great variety of (wearable) sensors without having to write individual code to access them.

Through our plugin mechanism, no code changes in the actual app are required to access data from a different sensor device while plugins for the devices have only to be written once and could easily be distributed over the already well-established app store concept.

Alongside, a filtering framework - designed in a similar way - provides easily re-usable data preprocessing capabilities.

## Setup

First install the plugin of the wearable device of your choice. To do so, open the plugin in Android Studio and change the run configuration at General --> Installation Options --> Deploy to nothing.

Then (order is important!) install the test app of MaskApp project.
